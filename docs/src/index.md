    <h3>Why Tachikoma?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>100% Julia</strong> — No C wrappers, Python, or ncurses. Just <code>Pkg.add</code> and go.</li>
      <li><strong>60–120+ fps</strong> — Double-buffered differential rendering. Only changed cells hit the terminal.</li>
      <li><strong>Compact Code</strong> — Full apps in 25 lines. Complex dashboards under 200.</li>
      <li><strong>Built-in Recording</strong> — Screencast any app to SVG, GIF, or <code>.tach</code> with one function call.</li>
      <li><strong>Virtual Terminal Testing</strong> — Headless rendering and scripted event injection for CI-friendly tests.</li>
